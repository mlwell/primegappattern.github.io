    I am not sure if this is new.&nbsp; The x-axis is the gap of prime numbers
    and y-axis the next gap.&nbsp; It includes gaps of the first 100,000 prime
    numbers.

    What is interesting is the pattern of holes. Conclusion or conjectures of
    this pattern<br />1. Gaps of 2 + 6n (n=0, 1,2 ...) will never have next gaps
    of 2 + 6n, except gaps between 3,5,7<br />2. Gaps of 4 + 6n (n=0, 1,2 ...)
    will never have next gaps of 4 + 6n<br />3. There is no consecutive twin
    gaps except 3,5,7
